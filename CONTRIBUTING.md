   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection.git
   cd breast-cancer-detection
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   python test_project.py
   pytest  # If using pytest
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## üìã Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Organization
```python
"""
Module docstring explaining purpose and usage.
"""

import standard_library
import third_party_libraries
import local_modules

# Constants
CONSTANT_NAME = "value"

class ClassName:
    """Class docstring."""
    
    def method_name(self, param: type) -> return_type:
        """Method docstring with parameters and return value."""
        pass

def function_name(param: type) -> return_type:
    """Function docstring."""
    pass
```

### Documentation Standards
- All public functions must have docstrings
- Use NumPy-style docstrings for consistency
- Include parameter types and descriptions
- Document return values and exceptions

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include integration tests for API endpoints

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Add appropriate tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   python test_project.py
   python model_training.py  # Ensure model training works
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

### Commit Message Format
Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New features
